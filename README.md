Example Voting App
=========

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

Getting started
---------------

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Mac or Windows. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 


## Linux Containers

The Linux stack uses Python, Node.js, .NET Core (or optionally Java), with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.


Architecture
-----

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) or [ASP.NET Core](/vote/dotnet) which lets you vote between two options
  **Docker Image: dockersamples/examplevotingapp_vote:before**
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) or [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/) queue which collects new votes
  **Docker Image: redis**
* A [.NET Core](/worker/src/Worker), [Java](/worker/src/main) or [.NET Core 2.1](/worker/dotnet) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
  **Docker Image: dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker**
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) or [TiDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockersamples/tidb/tags/) database backed by a Docker volume
  **Docker Image: postgres**
* A [Node.js](/result) or [ASP.NET Core SignalR](/result/dotnet) webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time
  **Docker Image: dockersamples/examplevotingapp_result:before**

Note
----

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
